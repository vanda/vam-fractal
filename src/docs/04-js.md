## Browsers

Javascript support is all modern browsers and for the MS Edge but no legacy versions of Internet Explorer are now supported. 


## Linting

Component Javascript is linted via ESLint using the [eslint-config-airbnb-base](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) ruleset. The configuration and custom rule set, `.eslintrc.json`, is found in the project root. 

Before writing or modifying Javascript in this project it is advised that you read through the documentation around the rules. In an effort to adhere to the standard please only add to the `.eslint.json` configuration if agreed and absolutely necessary. The same applies to inline overrides which can leave technical debt in the codebase.
